<h4>Project Details</h4><br>
<p>
  This is a code for a Python program that implements a Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) converter using the tkinter GUI library, the speech_recognition, and pyttsx3 modules. The program is designed to recognize voice input from the user and convert it to text or vice versa, depending on which button the user clicks.
